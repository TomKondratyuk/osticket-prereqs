<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

<p> Hello, this is my tutorial on how to install osTicket on your Windows system. First you will be using a virutal machine(VM) through microsoft Azure. This will give you good practice using Azure, the 2nd most popular cloud provider, which is often as valuable as formal job experience. As well as giving you experience connecting through Remote Desktop, which many Help Desk jobs use everyday to assist employees. And the cool thing is many Azure services offer free tiers or sandbox environments, so you can practice without significant costs.
  
1.) Create Azure Virutal Machine (VM) 
First Go to the Azure Portal and create and start up a Windows 10 Virtual Machine(VM) with at least 2-4 CPUs.

2.) Connect to your Virtual Machine (VM) via remote desktop. 
Next, connect to your Azure VM through Remote Desktop Connection, using your Azure VM's public IP address. 
Copy and Paste your Azure VM public IP.

![Capt5ure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cd4bfcd-1d64-479f-88fc-adceaf9a3b81)

Hit OK, and it should install the web server. 

3.) In your VM download the entire folder at this link ---> https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1APMfNyfNzcxZC6EzdaNfdZsUwxWYChf6


4.) Extract folder to your desktop and then open the "osTicket-Installion-Files" folder, install PHP Manager for IIS -> (PHPManagerForIIS_V1.5.0.msi)

5.) Also in the "osTicket-Installion-Files" folder, Install Rewrite Module. -> rewrite_amd64_en-US.msi

6.) Create A new folder on your Windows: (C) Drive. Named PHP

unzip and extract PHP 7.3.8 (php-7.3.8-nts-win32-VC15-x86.zip) into the "C \PHP" folder

7.) In "osTicket-Installion-Files" folder" -> Install VC_redist.x86

8.) In "osTicket-Installion-Files" folder" -> Install mysql-5.5.62-win32

Make root password: "root". 
This is bad practice in an acutal real life senario. However this is just for practice so let's keep it simple to not forget.

Keep going through and hit "Exute" --> then "Finish" when configuration is completed. 

9.) Open ISS as Admin. 

Hit start and search ISS, it should pop up. Hit run as Administrator. 

Open PHP manager

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14c7b589-a059-4a6f-a409-c7ff38c23c85)

Restart the ISS. In ISS manager -> open and start the server.

10.) Intstall osTicket v1.15.8

In the "osTicket-Installion-Files" folder. Extract "osTick v1.15.8.zip". 

Copy the "upload" folder from your extracted osTicket folder into your "c:\inetpub\wwwroot" folder

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1856d6f3-bd9c-4009-8ccb-2729ba195733)

rename "upload" to -> "osTicket" Exactly like this. *case sensitive*. 

Once again stop and start ISS Server in ISS Manager. 

11.) Go to sites -> Default -> osTicket
 Then On the right, click "Browse *:80*

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c1abb28-74f7-44cc-be03-875c78a76cfd)

If you did everything correctly you should see this page pop up. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6a6ce50-b411-4813-a6d5-40fe7887bd32)

If you get this error, it probably means you didn't rename the "upload" to "osTicket" correctly. Check for spaces or improper capitalization.
